# CPP_Basic_Programs
Just some basic programs for studying purposes

EX1:
Ex1 have a basic menu, and basic calculations, studying basic function and ordering.

Ex2 is like Ex1 but with diffrent calculations and functions

Ex3 is like Ex1 and Ex2 but with diffrent calculations and functions (again), its a little bit more complicated, but not too much. (still basic)
